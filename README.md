Hello, world! :wave:
</p>

At some point my interest in trading and investing introduced me to Python and led me down a fun road of learning all about its data-science stack. Now I spend my days building software and learning new skills, because that's what I :heart: doing. 

Besides freelancing, I occasionally work on [pandas_market_calendars](https://github.com/rsheftel/pandas_market_calendars), which I found to be an interesting alternative to [exchange_calendars](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars). If you want to see more, check out some of my pet projects below.

I love building the backend to applications, especially when lots of data is involved. If you could use some help, send me an e-mail at: marcel.pieper@outlook.com. You can do this in English, German or Dutch, since I am fluent in all of them. :smile:
