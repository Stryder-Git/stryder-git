Hello, world! :wave:
</p>

At some point my interest in trading and investing introduced me to Python, which led me to build all kinds of pet projects, while my passion for software development kept growing.

Now I practice my :heart: for automation at [ZippedScript](https://zippedscript.com). 

Occasionally, I also work on [pandas_market_calendars](https://github.com/rsheftel/pandas_market_calendars), which I found to be an interesting alternative to [exchange_calendars](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars). If you want to see more, check out some of my pet projects below.
