Hello, world! :wave:
</p>

I spend my days building software and learning new skills, because that's what I :heart: doing. 
Python was my first programming love and I enjoyed learning all about its data-science stack but I am using more and more of C++, C#, and Javascript right now. 

I regularly work on [pandas_market_calendars](https://github.com/rsheftel/pandas_market_calendars), which is an interesting alternative to [exchange_calendars](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars) 

If you need someone to help you with a data related project, you can send me an e-mail at: marcel.pieper@outlook.com
