Hello, world! :wave:
</p>

At some point my interest in trading and investing introduced me to Python, which led me to build all kinds of pet projects, while my passion for software development kept growing.

I made a lot of contributions to  [pandas_market_calendars](https://github.com/rsheftel/pandas_market_calendars), which I found to be an interesting alternative to [exchange_calendars](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars).

I also practiced my :heart: for automation at [ZippedScript](https://zippedscript.com), but I have now moved on to work more independently. 

To contact me, find out more about me, or see what personal projects I have been working on, check out [my website](https://thedevmind.com).
